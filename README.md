## Note: 

   **For the Above input paragraph the incorrect output as a result of improper use of spaces after '.' and ','.  So currently 	  	you have to keep in mind while writing the paragraph to consider proper use of spaces. Because this is not an intelligence-	based program this is simple rule-based. I will keep being updating the rules so that it can cover maximum cases.**
